    <mark>[Link]</mark> Story: The Chase</a>
<h1 style="background-color:Lavender" style="text-align:center;">Purpose: </h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">  The objective of the story is to make decisions that 
will enable the player to successfully escape from the killer. In order to create 
this, my partner, Odum Hit, and I used the Scratch programming language. The program
had algorithms with logical steps and mathematical concepts. In other words, a 
condition will occur if certain sprites are clicked by the player, which as a result
affect the outcome. The player was given different choices of whether aiding a person 
in need, what direction to go, or action to take. For this, different acts and scenes
were created. The purpose of the code was to ensure the player had a smooth transition
from scene to scene by incoporating wait times. Once an act was triggered, they acted as a one-way-flag to 
prevent the player from going back to change the outcome of that play. Of course, 
the player was able to restart the game if they deemed necessary. Ultimately, our 
project was in fact interactive. </p>
<br>
<h1 style="background-color:Lavender" style="text-align:center;">Reflection: </h1>

<p style="text-align:center;">      Throughout the project, I was able to learn more about
programming and about my own knowledge. My partner and I were able to create an effective 
code, however there were some weakness. For instance, the music was not able to play 
for all scenes. In the future, I would like to improve this by combining different 
codes to ensure it plays. I also believed our code was too simple and would like to 
create a far more complex code in the future. This can be done by incoporationg more 
algorithms than the changing scenes or the conditions set. These additions will provide 
the user with the adequate atmosphere and mood for the story. Despite this, the sprites
created were effective in the story. Additionally, through the project I learned how
to be able to edit images to my liking. Our project incoporated different scenes so
I was able to edit images in an online software accordingly to the theme of the story.
Hopefully in the future I will be able to use this skill again and continue to improve
it to create more aesthetically pleasing scenes. All in all, I truly enjoyed this project 
and look forward to the incoming ones. </p>

<h1 style="background-color:Lavender" style="text-align:center;">Reflection: </h1>

<p style="text-align:center;"> The App Inventor project was done to create an app that works
as a tool to the user. My partner and I decided to create an app that would enable the student
to become organized. The user has the choice of using the planner, task list, alarm, and calendar. Each 
feature in the app is meant to be used by the user to keep track of their studying activities and additional 
school management. The code was effective and ran smoothly, however, it had some weaknesses. For example, I believe
the app would be better if it allowed the user to customize the app, such as background color or different alarm 
sounds. Additionally, I would like to learn how to possibly add moving animations in each screen to provide the user
with a more aesthetically pleasing screen. In conclusion, the project helped me develop the skills needed to create a 
functionable app and even made me think about creating my own mobile application in the future to help students just 
like me. </P>

    <mark>[Click Here to Read the Rest!!]</mark> The Story of Shrek</a>
<h1 style="background-color:Lavender" style="text-align:center;">Reflection: </h1>

<p style="text-align:center;">  The Interactive Story project was created in the progamming language 
of Python 2.7.10. the objective of the project was to create an interactive story for the user
to follow. The story provided the user with decisions, each decision would affect how the stpry unravels. 
My partner, Robert Olivares, and I started the process with coming up with the characters and 
setting of the story to create a plot. Following that step, we created a story map to plan how 
each decision would affect the next scene in the story. Throughout the project, my partner and I 
referred back to the story map to ensure all decisions had an outcome. The story was made possible
with the Python code that contained defined functions, if-else structure, and raw input from the
user. The defined fuctions worked as scenes played out by what the user chooses to do. The if-else
structure and raw input were used to give the user options on what to do and to call the next 
scene after the decision. To say the truth, the story ended up being quite lengthy with the different 
scenes and outcomes. Despite its length, the code was simple to follow with occasionally mishaps 
as there is various decisions to follow. For future improvements, I would like to create a shorter 
story with detail to provide the user with an interesting story but without the inconvinience of 
how long it takes them to read the whole story.

    <mark>[View all Versions]</mark> Word Scramble</a>

<h1 style="background-color:Lavender" style="text-align:center;">Reflection: </h1>
<p style="text-align:center;"> In this project, the programming language used was Python 2.7.10. The program 
was made with the purpose to entertain the user or player with a fun game of word scrambling. 
The game helps the user pass time and helps the user get accustomed to the spelling of certain words, which can 
be useful for learning youths.The game has a total of thirty six words that are automatically scrambled and 
given to the player one by one if answered correctly. There are three different categories for the words:
animal names, foods, and sport names along with three opportuities to guess the correct answer. The project
requirements called for different versions of the gane that displays changes in the code to improve the 
game. I worked with my partners, Bella and Connor, to create three different versions.The first version only 
allows the player one trial to guess the correct answer, the second version was improved by allowing the player 
various trials to guess the correct answer through the use of Boolean date along with while loops. The final stage 
has the improvement to allow the player to correctly guess the answer after two tries as it provides the player 
with a hint about the correct answer. To reflect on the code, the code was initially simple but the final stage was 
more complex with the added features. My partners and I worked accordingly to ensure the code would not crash if 
the user made an error. However, if any possible improvements, I would like to add additionally features to the 
code to handle user error, such as restarting the game if the user desires or eliminating words after the player 
has correctly answered it.

<h1 style="background-color:Lavender" style="text-align:center;">Reflection: </h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">  The manipulation project was created with the progamming language of 
Python, with the objective to manipulate an image in order to created an edited version. The code found 
in Canopy starts with opening the file, or image, in the same directory as the Python script. Following
that, the code uses the subplot command to show the original picture in a figure window. Next, the code 
continues with opening the selected image of the eyes and resizing them in order to fit the frame of
the celebrity, Joey, found in the original image. The eyes are then pasted into the given coordinates 
to make the right eye as well as the left eye. This version of the image is saved under the name
"Overpowereddd". The final version of the image is created by simply rotating the whole image and displaying 
the image. The final edited image is saved as a JPEG file under the name of "FlippedJoey". Personally. this 
project was easier to grasp than the initial projects we did in class using python. After practicing
possible codes, I started feeling comfortable with the coding itself. My partner and I struggled 
with saving the image into the correct file, but then realized our directory was incorrect. Now, I always
make sure to constantly check that the directory is correct in order to save time. This project taught me the 
basics with image manipulation along with new commands to use when coding with images. In the future, I would like 
to continue practicing certain codes such as changing the background, combining various images as one, and 
adding additional pixels in order to manipulate images.
