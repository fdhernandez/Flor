<h1 style="text-align:center;">This is my About Me Page!</h1>
<p  style="text-align:center;"> ~~Hello, I am Flor Hernandez. I am currently 16 years old and a junior.
   I'm part of my highschool's Wrestling team, and I love it!
   Personally, I have a love for Science, Math, along with a hatred for English. 
    Anyways, I have been the same height since 6th grade (5'0) and can be quite impulsive, 
    but you can not blame me, I have to make up my height with my attitude. One day 
    I aspire to grow at least a couple more inches. Also, I have two small dogs back home, who
    I spoil too much. ~~ </p>
