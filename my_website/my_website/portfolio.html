    <mark>[Link]</mark> Story: The Chase</a>
<h1 style="background-color:Lavender" style="text-align:center;">Purpose: </h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">  The objective of the story is to make decisions that 
will enable the player to successfully escape from the killer. In order to create 
this, my partner, Odum Hit, and I used the Scratch programming language. The program
had algorithms with logical steps and mathematical concepts. In other words, a 
condition will occur if certain sprites are clicked by the player, which as a result
affect the outcome. The player was given different choices of whether aiding a person 
in need, what direction to go, or action to take. For this, different acts and scenes
were created. The purpose of the code was to ensure the player had a smooth transition
from scene to scene by incoporating wait times. Once an act was triggered, they acted as a one-way-flag to 
prevent the player from going back to change the outcome of that play. Of course, 
the player was able to restart the game if they deemed necessary. Ultimately, our 
project was in fact interactive. </p>
<br>
<h1 style="background-color:Lavender" style="text-align:center;">Reflection: </h1>

<p style="text-align:center;">      Throughout the project, I was able to learn more about
programming and about my own knowledge. My partner and I were able to create an effective 
code, however there were some weakness. For instance, the music was not able to play 
for all scenes. In the future, I would like to improve this by combining different 
codes to ensure it plays. I also believed our code was too simple and would like to 
create a far more complex code in the future. This can be done by incoporationg more 
algorithms than the changing scenes or the conditions set. These additions will provide 
the user with the adequate atmosphere and mood for the story. Despite this, the sprites
created were effective in the story. Additionally, through the project I learned how
to be able to edit images to my liking. Our project incoporated different scenes so
I was able to edit images in an online software accordingly to the theme of the story.
Hopefully in the future I will be able to use this skill again and continue to improve
it to create more aesthetically pleasing scenes. All in all, I truly enjoyed this project 
and look forward to the incoming ones. </p>

<h1 style="background-color:Lavender" style="text-align:center;">Reflection: </h1>

<p style="text-align:center;"> The App Inventor project was done to create an app that works
as a tool to the user. My partner and I decided to create an app that would enable the student
to become organized. The user has the choice of using the planner, task list, alarm, and calendar. Each 
feature in the app is meant to be used by the user to keep track of their studying activities and additional 
school management. The code was effective and ran smoothly, however, it had some weaknesses. For example, I believe
the app would be better if it allowed the user to customize the app, such as background color or different alarm 
sounds. Additionally, I would like to learn how to possibly add moving animations in each screen to provide the user
with a more aesthetically pleasing screen. In conclusion, the project helped me develop the skills needed to create a 
functionable app and even made me think about creating my own mobile application in the future to help students just 
like me. </P>

<h1 style="background-color:Lavender" style="text-align:center;">Reflection: </h1>

<p style="text-align:center;">  The Interactive Story project was created in the progamming language 
of Python 2.7.10. the objective of the project was to create an interactive story for the user
to follow. The story provided the user with decisions, each decision would affect how the stpry unravels. 
My partner, Robert Olivares, and I started the process with coming up with the characters and 
setting of the story to create a plot. Following that step, we created a story map to plan how 
each decision would affect the next scene in the story. Throughout the project, my partner and I 
referred back to the story map to ensure all decisions had an outcome. The story was made possible
with the Python code that contained defined functions, if-else structure, and raw input from the
user. The defined fuctions worked as scenes played out by what the user chooses to do. The if-else
structure and raw input were used to give the user options on what to do and to call the next 
scene after the decision. To say the truth, the story ended up being quite lengthy with the different 
scenes and outcomes. Despite its length, the code was simple to follow with occasionally mishaps 
as there is various decisions to follow. For future improvements, I would like to create a shorter 
story with detail to provide the user with an interesting story but without the inconvinience of 
how long it takes them to read the whole story.

    <mark>[View all Versions]</mark> Word Scramble</a>

<h1 style="background-color:Lavender" style="text-align:center;">Reflection: </h1>
<p style="text-align:center;"> In this project, the programming language used was Python 2.7.10. The program 
was made with the purpose to entertain the user or player with a fun game of word scrambling. 
The game helps the user pass time and helps the user get accustomed to the spelling of certain words, which can 
be useful for learning youths.The game has a total of thirty six words that are automatically scrambled and 
given to the player one by one if answered correctly. There are three different categories for the words:
animal names, foods, and sport names along with three opportuities to guess the correct answer. The project
requirements called for different versions of the gane that displays changes in the code to improve the 
game. I worked with my partners, Bella and Connor, to create three different versions.The first version only 
allows the player one trial to guess the correct answer, the second version was improved by allowing the player 
various trials to guess the correct answer through the use of Boolean date along with while loops. The final stage 
has the improvement to allow the player to correctly guess the answer after two tries as it provides the player 
with a hint about the correct answer. To reflect on the code, the code was initially simple but the final stage was 
more complex with the added features. My partners and I worked accordingly to ensure the code would not crash if 
the user made an error. However, if any possible improvements, I would like to add additionally features to the 
code to handle user error, such as restarting the game if the user desires or eliminating words after the player 
has correctly answered it.

<h1 style="background-color:Lavender" style="text-align:center;">Reflection: </h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">  The manipulation project was created with the progamming language of 
Python, with the objective to manipulate an image in order to created an edited version. The code found 
in Canopy starts with opening the file, or image, in the same directory as the Python script. Following
that, the code uses the subplot command to show the original picture in a figure window. Next, the code 
continues with opening the selected image of the eyes and resizing them in order to fit the frame of
the celebrity, Joey, found in the original image. The eyes are then pasted into the given coordinates 
to make the right eye as well as the left eye. This version of the image is saved under the name
"Overpowereddd". The final version of the image is created by simply rotating the whole image and displaying 
the image. The final edited image is saved as a JPEG file under the name of "FlippedJoey". Personally. this 
project was easier to grasp than the initial projects we did in class using python. After practicing
possible codes, I started feeling comfortable with the coding itself. My partner and I struggled 
with saving the image into the correct file, but then realized our directory was incorrect. Now, I always
make sure to constantly check that the directory is correct in order to save time. This project taught me the 
basics with image manipulation along with new commands to use when coding with images. In the future, I would like 
to continue practicing certain codes, such as changing the background, combining various images as one, and 
adding additional pixels in order to manipulate images.

    <mark>[Click Here to View the Rest]</mark> SQL Injection</a>
<h1 style="background-color:Lavender" style="text-align:center;">Reflection: </h1>
<p style="text-align:center;"> The objective of this assignment was to obtain and present information about 
a selected malware, this one being the SQL injection. To initiate the research, we were partnered up and 
were given time to choose a desire malware. My partner, Noah, and I selected SQL Injection as it consists of
data bases and the language is closer to human-language. To note, SQL injcetions are one of the most common 
walwares found in the internet. To start of, we used Office 365 Powerpoint in order to be able to 
simultaneously work on the presentation without distorted each others research. By using this service, we were able to
split the work equally and complete the assignment before the due date. Noah choice to present information about the 
timeline and possible user protection from the injection. I attained information about the language, vunerability,
and exploit of the malware.SQL Injections occurs when a developer accepts user input directly placed into a 
SQL(Structured Query Language) Statement and does not properly validate or filter out dangerous characters. By doimg
so, the attacker can control the server and manipulate the data, Most occurences of the injection results in the attacker
inserting expolited statements into the database, allowing him/her to delete and obtain personal data from the web page.
The first instance of the SQL injection was discovered in December 1998 by the hacker and security consultant, 
Jeff Forristal, also know as the Rain Forest Puppy. As mentioned before, SQL injcetion is very common annd still continues
to be a security threat. However, there are possible measures that can be taken to prevent injection, such as continously
validatng and sanitizing data submitted by users. After all the information was added to the different slides, we provided
various visuals for the audience. Overall, the presentation reached its intended purpose, yet, I acknowledge possible
improvements for the future. To improve the presentation I would like to add additional facts about Jeff and explore
how exactly he was able to discover the malware as well as adding more visuals for the presentation. </p>

<h1 style="background-color:Lavender" style="text-align:center;">Reflection: </h1>
<p style="text-align:center;"> Through the presentation, the task at hand was to introduce a computing innovation 
related to big data collection or processing. Through sraching credible sources for an innovation, I came across 
the Square Kilometre Array. The purpose of the innovation is to answer the unkwon questions about our universe, 
going back to the fist stars and to learn how black holes formed an era most known as the "Dark Ages". Without 
a doubt, the SKA will enable astronomers to map the dark matter distribution across the universe. All these
actions would be done through bid data collection and big data processing as it uses volume and velocity. For
instance, the SKA would ingest one terabyte of data per second, that has an equivalent of roughly a million minutes
of music in just seconds. Quite incredible! Despite its benefits, the SKA will also raise concerns for data analygists
are still unsure on how will they be capable of storing such amounts of data. Additionally,the telescope would be in 
need of supercomputers, which could be an expense concern for how much they cost to manufacture. Evidently, big data 
holds its benefits and cons, however, it holds a promising future. If I were to given more time to modify my presentation,
I would like to provide the audience with examples of how exactly data would be processed and trasported through the SKA and
also add more details concerning the developers of the innovation. </p>

    <mark>[Click Here to View Raw Data]</mark> Dog Adoptions Raw Data</a>
<h1 style="background-color:Lavender" style="text-align:center;">Reflection: </h1>
<p style="text-align:center;"> The purpose of the data analysis was to answer the question about which month dogs are adopted 
the most cumulatively from the years 2012 to 2017 in Los Angeles, California. My partner, Katrina, and I were wanted to answer
this question because we were aware that  the amount of dogs in shelters has increased over the years,so we wanted to know 
if the amount of adoptions has increased as well. Futhermore, this also enables us to see when dog adoptions are the most in 
trend. To obtain the raw data, we surfed the web and found statistics provided by the Department of Animal Services and converted 
the file into an excel document. Of course, we removed unnecessary data as it would distort our results. From there, we used the values
to create a pie chart and bar graph. Based on the dats, July proves to be the most popular month for dog adoptions. If further reasearch
done on the topic, I would be able to examine more factors that could affect dog adoptions, this way we would obtain a greater insight 
into when truly is the time to adopt.
