    <mark>[Link]</mark> Story: The Chase</a>
<h1 style="background-color:Tomato" style="text-align:center;">Purpose </h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">  The objective of the story is to make decisions that 
will enable the player to successfully escape from the killer. In order to create 
this, my partner, Odum Hit, and I used a basic programming language. The program
had algorithms with logical steps and mathematical concepts. In other words, a 
condition will occur if certain sprites are clicked by the player, which as a result
affect the outcome. The player was given different choices of whether aiding a person 
in need, what direction to go, or action to take. For this, different acts and scenes
were created. The purpose of the code was to ensure the player had a smooth transition
from scene to scene by incoporating wait times. Once an act was triggered, they acted as a one-way-flag to 
prevent the player from going back to change the outcome of that play. Of course, 
the player was able to restart the game if they deemed necessary. Ultimately, our 
project was in fact interactive. </p>

<h1 style="background-color:Tomato" style="text-align:center;">Reflection </h1>

<p style="text-align:center;">      Throughout the project, I was able to learn more about
programmming and about my own knowledge. My partner and I were able to create an effective 
code, however there were some weakness. For instance, the music was not able to play 
for all scenes. In the future, I would like to improve this by combining different 
codes to ensure it plays. I also believed our code was too simple and would like to 
create a far more complex code in the future. This can be done by incoporationg more 
abstractions than the changing scenes or the conditions set. Despite this, the sprites
created were effective in the story. Additionally, through the project I learned how
to be able to edit images to my liking. Our project incoporated different scenes so
I was able to edit images in an online software accordingly to the theme of the story.
Hopefullly in the futre I will be able to use this skill again and continue to improve
it to create more aesthetically pleasing scenes. All in all, I truly enjoyed this project 
and look forward to the incoming ones. </p>
